Introduction</h1>\n\n<p>Drug use in Australia is a complex issue. According to the National Drug Strategy Household Survey, alcohol is the most widely used drug in Australia, with around two-thirds of the population reporting consuming it in the past year. Cannabis is the most commonly used illicit drug, followed by use of prescription and over-the-counter medications. The use of methamphetamine, including ice, is a significant concern in some parts of the country. The Australian government has implemented a range of measures to address drug use, including prevention, early intervention, treatment, and harm reduction strategies.</p>\n\n<p>The datasets provided are related to the burden of illicit drug use in Australia, including data on linked diseases, consumer and provider arrests, hospitalizations, and deaths. They contain information on specific drug types and classes, as well as demographic information such as gender and remoteness area. These datasets provide a comprehensive overview of the impact of illicit drug use in Australia, and can be used to understand patterns and trends in drug-related harms over time.</p>\n\n<p>This notebook is to provide insights and as well work on my own visualisation and report building skills. The data provided in this notebook has also been sourced outside of Kaggle and I have combined it so we can all have a bit of fun with this data.

The first drug that comes to mind when thinking about \"a drug problem\"</h1>\n\n<p>From the sample data gathered from the National Drugs Strategy Household Survey, it seems that the perception of what constitutes a \"drug problem\" is similar between males and females in Australia. For example, both males and females reported that the most common drug that comes to mind when thinking about \"a drug problem\" is Methamphetamine, with approximately 47% of respondents from both genders reporting it as the first drug that comes to mind. This suggests that there is a general consensus among both males and females about the seriousness of this particular drug.</p>\n\n<p>The second most common drug that comes to mind for both males and females is Heroin, with approximately 14% of females and 13% of males reporting it as the first drug that comes to mind. Alcohol and Marijuana|Cannabis are also commonly thought of as the first drug that comes to mind when thinking about \"a drug problem\" by both males and females, with around 7% of males and 6% of females reporting it.</p>\n\n<p>The sample also shows that there are some differences in the percentage of males and females who report specific drugs as the first one that comes to mind when thinking about \"a drug problem.\" For example, a higher percentage of females than males report Ecstasy and Pain-killers|Analgesics|Opioids as the first drug that comes to mind.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, the data suggests that there is some commonality in the drugs that come to mind when thinking about \"a drug problem\" for both males and females in Australia, but also some differences in the specific drugs that are thought of.</p>\n\n<h4>Comments for visualisation below:</h4>\n\n<p>The plots for male and female perception (not overall perception) are coloured to highlight \"red\" where they differ in perception and \"dark\" where there were no differences.</p>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"data_1 = data.groupby(['Sex','A1'])['A1'].count().to_dict()\n\ntotal_female = data.Sex.value_counts().to_dict()['Female']\ntotal_male = data.Sex.value_counts().to_dict()['Male']\n\npercentage_data = {(gender, drug): (value/total_female if gender == \"Female\" else value/total_male) * 100 for (gender, drug), value in data_1.items()}\n\n# create the figure and axes for the subplot\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(3, 1, figsize=(10, 10))\n\n# separate data for males and females\nmale_data = {k[1]:v for k,v in percentage_data.items() if k[0] == 'Male'}\nfemale_data = {k[1]:v for k,v in percentage_data.items() if k[0] == 'Female'}\n\n# sorting values\nmale_data = dict(sorted(male_data.items(), key=lambda x: x[1]))\nfemale_data = dict(sorted(female_data.items(), key=lambda x: x[1]))\n\n# create the bar plots for males and females\nmale_bars = ax[0].barh(list(male_data.keys()), list(male_data.values()))\nfemale_bars = ax[1].barh(list(female_data.keys()), list(female_data.values()))\n\n# loop through each drug in the data\nfor i, drug in enumerate(male_data.keys()):\n    # if the percentage for the current drug is similar for both males and females\n    if abs(male_data[drug] - female_data[drug]) <= 0.5:\n        # set the color of the bar to dark\n        male_bars[i].set_color('#444444')\n        female_bars[i].set_color('#444444')\n    else:\n        # set the color of the bar to red\n        male_bars[i].set_color('#F05454')\n        female_bars[i].set_color('#F05454')\n        \nfor i in male_data.keys():\n    ax[0].annotate(f\"{round(male_data[i],2)}%\", xy=(male_data[i] + 1.45, i),va = 'center', ha='center',fontsize=8,fontweight='light')\n    \nfor i in female_data.keys():\n    ax[1].annotate(f\"{round(female_data[i],2)}%\", xy=(female_data[i] + 1.45, i),va = 'center', ha='center',fontsize=8,fontweight='light')\n    \n# creating overall (male and female included)\ndata_1 = round((data.A1.value_counts()/len(data)*100),2).to_dict()\n\n# color for overall plot\ncolors = list(reversed(['#F05454','#F28C8C','#F5B5B5','#F8DFDF','#FBFBFB'] + [\"#FBFBFB\" for i in range(len(data_1)-5)]))\n\n# bar plot\ndata_1 = dict(sorted(data_1.items(), key=lambda x: x[1]))\nax[2].barh(list(data_1.keys()), list(data_1.values()), color=colors,edgecolor='#171717',linewidth=0.5)\n\nfor i in data_1.keys():\n    ax[2].annotate(f\"{data_1[i]}%\", xy=(data_1[i] + 1.45, i),va = 'center', ha='center',fontsize=8,fontweight='light')\n\n[ax[i].spines[s].set_visible(False) for i in range(3) for s in ['top','right','bottom']]\n    \n# set title and labels for the subplot\nax[0].set_title(\"Male perception of 'Drug problem'\")\nax[1].set_title(\"Female perception of 'Drug problem'\")\nax[2].set_title(\"Overall perception of 'Drug problem'\")\n[ax[i].set_xticks([]) for i in range(3)]\nax[0].grid(axis='y', linestyle=':', alpha=0.2)\nax[1].grid(axis='y', linestyle=':', alpha=0.2)\nax[2].grid(axis='y', linestyle=':', alpha=0.2)\nax[0].set_yticklabels(male_data.keys(),fontsize=8)\nax[1].set_yticklabels(female_data.keys(),fontsize=8)\nax[2].set_yticklabels(data_1.keys(),fontsize=8)\nfig.tight_layout()\nplt.show()","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-01-28T07:14:16.826304Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-01-28T07:14:16.826713Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-01-28T07:14:19.487645Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-01-28T07:14:16.826677Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-01-28T07:14:19.486071Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"section-2A\"></a>\n<h1>2A.

This suggests that a majority of the arrests in the consumer dataset are likely to be of individuals who possess drugs for personal use, while a majority of the arrests in the provider dataset are likely to be of individuals who possess drugs for distribution or sale. Furthermore, the percentage change in arrests between the two datasets also differs, with some drug types having a higher increase in consumer arrests and a decrease in provider arrests, and vice versa. This may suggest that the law enforcement agencies are focusing more on certain types of drugs or certain types of individuals.</p>\n\n<p>It appears that Amphetamine-type stimulants have the highest number of arrests for consumers and providers, with 86.3 and 10.9 arrests per 100,000 population, respectively. Additionally, these arrests have seen an increase of 62.22% and -48.1% per change respectively.

Final thoughts</h1>\n\n<p>The data gathered from the National Drugs Strategy Household Survey and the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare suggests that there is a general consensus among both males and females in Australia about the seriousness of certain drugs, such as Methamphetamine and Heroin, as the most common drugs that come to mind when thinking about \"a drug problem.\" However, there are some differences in the specific drugs that are thought of, with higher percentages of females than males reporting Ecstasy and Pain-killers as the first drug that comes to mind.</p>\n    \n<p>The data also shows that there are key differences and similarities between the age groups in terms of what drugs they believe cause the most deaths, with Alcohol being considered the highest across all age groups and Methamphetamine being considered the third highest across all age groups. The data also suggests that there is an upward trend in the rate of drug-induced deaths in Australia, with Opioids and Depressants being significant contributors.When comparing the age-standardized rates of alcohol-induced deaths and alcohol-related deaths, it can be seen that the rate of alcohol-induced deaths is consistently lower than the rate of alcohol-related deaths, suggesting that while alcohol may be a contributing factor in many deaths, it is not always the direct cause. Additionally, the data suggests that there is a higher number of consumer arrests as compared to provider arrests, which may suggest that the law enforcement agencies are focusing more on certain types of drugs or certain types of individuals.</p>\n\n<p>The leading causes of burden of disease and injury in Australia due to alcohol and illicit drug use in 2021 are drug use disorders, accidental poisoning, and chronic liver disease. Additionally, there is a significant burden of disease due to suicide and self-inflicted injuries and liver cancer. The data also suggests that there is a relatively lower burden of disease and injury caused by mental health conditions such as anxiety, depressive disorders, and schizophrenia. The data also shows that males are more prone to drug use disorders, suicide and self-inflicted injuries, chronic liver disease, and liver cancer than females. Additionally, males are more prone to HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (acute), Hepatitis C (acute), Road traffic injuries (motorcyclists and vehicle occupants), anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, and schizophrenia than females. It is important to address the issue of alcohol and illicit drug use as it has a significant impact on the burden of disease and injury in Australia.</p>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h5>Created by:</h5>\n<h6>Brandon Smith 28/01/23</h6>","metadata":{}}]}
