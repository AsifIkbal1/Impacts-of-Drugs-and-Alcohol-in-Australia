<h1>1. Introduction</h1>

<p>Drug use in Australia is a complex issue. According to the National Drug Strategy Household Survey, alcohol is the most widely used drug in Australia, with around two-thirds of the population reporting consuming it in the past year. Cannabis is the most commonly used illicit drug, followed by use of prescription and over-the-counter medications. The use of methamphetamine, including ice, is a significant concern in some parts of the country. The Australian government has implemented a range of measures to address drug use, including prevention, early intervention, treatment, and harm reduction strategies.</p>

<p>The datasets provided are related to the burden of illicit drug use in Australia, including data on linked diseases, consumer and provider arrests, hospitalizations, and deaths. They contain information on specific drug types and classes, as well as demographic information such as gender and remoteness area. These datasets provide a comprehensive overview of the impact of illicit drug use in Australia, and can be used to understand patterns and trends in drug-related harms over time.</p>

<p>This notebook is to provide insights and as well work on my own visualisation and report building skills. The data provided in this notebook has also been sourced outside of Kaggle and I have combined it so we can all have a bit of fun with this data. Please provide feedback where possible to further build my skills in visualisation techniques and reporting.</p>

<h1>2. The first drug that comes to mind when thinking about "a drug problem"</h1>

<p>From the sample data gathered from the National Drugs Strategy Household Survey, it seems that the perception of what constitutes a "drug problem" is similar between males and females in Australia. For example, both males and females reported that the most common drug that comes to mind when thinking about "a drug problem" is Methamphetamine, with approximately 47% of respondents from both genders reporting it as the first drug that comes to mind. This suggests that there is a general consensus among both males and females about the seriousness of this particular drug.</p>

<p>The second most common drug that comes to mind for both males and females is Heroin, with approximately 14% of females and 13% of males reporting it as the first drug that comes to mind. Alcohol and Marijuana|Cannabis are also commonly thought of as the first drug that comes to mind when thinking about "a drug problem" by both males and females, with around 7% of males and 6% of females reporting it.</p>

<p>The sample also shows that there are some differences in the percentage of males and females who report specific drugs as the first one that comes to mind when thinking about "a drug problem." For example, a higher percentage of females than males report Ecstasy and Pain-killers|Analgesics|Opioids as the first drug that comes to mind.</p>

<p>Overall, the data suggests that there is some commonality in the drugs that come to mind when thinking about "a drug problem" for both males and females in Australia, but also some differences in the specific drugs that are thought of.</p>

<h4>Comments for visualisation below:</h4>

<p>The plots for male and female perception (not overall perception) are coloured to highlight "red" where they differ in perception and "dark" where there were no differences.</p>
